Similar to last week, you will do some work implementing your own versions of these algorithms, to ensure that you understand the details of them. You will also compare them with the implementations in scikit-learn to test your implementations."

    "# Question 1: k-nearest neighbours classification\n",
    "In this question we will use the k-nearest neighbours algorithm to make predictions on the breast cancer Wisconsin dataset. This is a classification problem where the aim is to classify instances as either being malignant or benign based on the following 10 features:\n",
    "1. radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)\n",
    "2. texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)\n",
    "3. perimeter\n",
    "4. area\n",
    "5. smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)\n",
    "6. compactness (perimeter squared/ area −1)\n",
    "7. concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)\n",
    "8. concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)\n",
    "9. symmetry\n",
    "10. fractal dimension (‘coastline approximation’ −1)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this question you will (a) download the dataset from sklearn and store the data and targets in suitable variables, (b) separate your data into a training and test split, (c) write your own function to implement k-nearest neighbours, (d) check your implementation with that of sklearn. Wethen go on to (e) select the most appropriate value of $k$ using cross-validation."
